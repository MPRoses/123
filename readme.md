# 101Mailz - school project.
## Final thoughts:
> In this project, I followed a strategy that I do not normally follow: 'go with the flow'. This strategy is reflected throughout the project, from the reuse of syntaxis to hard-to-read front-end code - sorry about that.
Even though there is still quite some CSS involved, I did not focus so much on the front-end design (normally I create entire design plans and now I just went with what makes sense). The focus of this project was more on the backend and the general functionality and that made me learn a lot about accounts, hashing, databases and more. 
Despite the sucess of this project I will probably not be returning to nodeJS anytime soon, but I look back on this project with pride.
