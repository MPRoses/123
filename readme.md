# 101Mailz - school project.
## Final thoughts:
> In this project, I followed a strategy that I do not normally follow: 'go with the flow'. This strategy is reflected throughout the project, from the reuse of syntaxis to hard-to-read front-end code - sorry about that. Even though there is still quite some CSS involved, I did not focus so much on the front-end design. The focus of this project was more on the   backend and the general functionality. I learned a lot about accounts, hashing and databases. I will probably not be returning to nodeJS anytime soon to nodeJS, but I look back on this project with pride. >
